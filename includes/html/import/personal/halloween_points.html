	<!-- <div class="title">WebGL Rendering Engine</div> -->
	<!-- <div class="description">Graphics programming had started to fascinate me so I spent 2 months learning barebones WebGL and ES SL shaders. Ended up with a renderer that supports proper bloom, sun shafts and reflections among other basic graphic features. Runtime is fairly good for a browser, at half resolution it runs at ~1-3ms/frame on an integrated macbook GPU. Suprisingly that leaves enough overhead for game code to run on.</div> -->
