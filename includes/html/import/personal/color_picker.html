	<div class="title">Relative Luminance Color Picker</div>
	<div class="description">I start & finish new projects every week or two and frankly colours are a hassle. I saw that some artists use a technique called greyscale painting which has them choosing colours based on relative brightness and only seeing the final product at the end. The goal of this project was to accomplish the same thing. I wanted to be able to easily choose a green that is the same perceived brightness as my blue, a red that is just as bright as my yellow etc.

		In UX perceived color brightness is one of many things that draws attention to an area of the screen and I wanted more control over it as no other color picker supports it.</div>
